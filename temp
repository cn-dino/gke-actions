push.yml (Test & lint when (people create a feature branch):

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*/*'
      -  '*'
      - '!master' 
 

master.yml (To deploy to a Staging environment):

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Push events on master branch
 

and finally I have release.yml (to deploy to production when we create a new tag):

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - releases/* # Push events to branches matching refs/heads/releases/*
